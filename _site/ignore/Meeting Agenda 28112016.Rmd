Dear all,

Based on discussions with Tore, we propose the following agenda for the meeting:


1200  Short round of presentation of participants and highlight the most relevant prior research results in the field.

1230  Preparation of research plan we go through the WPs and discuss time line and priorities the first year. It is crucial that WP 2 starts as soon as possible since WP 3 and 4 depends to the findings.
        Paul will be with us on skype for the time needed, and Kristin and I will meet with Paul in Mexico during COP to pin down further details. What will be other research tasks for 2017?

路        This will include identifying other technology programs in the NFR for collabortion/fact-finding. 

路        As part of this work we will need to develop a plan for publication (who, what, when and where)


1630 Cross cutting issues for the project are 

路        Making a dissemination strategy, jf. prosjektbeskrivelsens pkt 5 This will include 
路        Yearly seminares 
路        Participation in public debates (Hva, hvordan osv)


I wish you all a warm welcome to Polh酶gda!

See you soon!
Morten
